# Create a JavaScript Promise

A promise in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like - you use it to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task completes, you either fulfill your promise or fail to do so. `Promise` is a constructor function, so you need to use the `new` keyword to create one. It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - `resolve` and `reject`. These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise. The syntax looks like this:

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
```

---

Create a new promise called `makeServerRequest`. Pass in a function with `resolve` and `reject` parameters to the constructor.

---

## Tests

- You should assign a promise to a declared variable named `makeServerRequest`.
- Your promise should receive a function with `resolve` and `reject` as parameters.
