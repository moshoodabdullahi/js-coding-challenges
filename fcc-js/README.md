# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures repository! This repository contains the course materials and projects for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. The certification covers various aspects of JavaScript programming, including ES6, regular expressions, debugging, data structures, algorithm scripting, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and more.

Each course is organized into its own subfolder within this repository. Below is a list of the subfolders you'll find:

- [es6](./es6/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the ES6 course.
- [regular-expressions](./regular-expressions/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the Regular Expressions course.
- [debugging](./debugging/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the Debugging course.
- [basic-data-structures](./basic-data-structures/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the Basic Data Structures course.
- [basic-algorithm-scripting](./basic-algorithm-scripting/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the Basic Algorithm Scripting course.
- [object-oriented-programming](./object-oriented-programming/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the Object Oriented Programming course.
- [functional-programming](./functional-programming/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the Functional Programming course.
- [intermediate-algorithm-scripting](./intermediate-algorithm-scripting/): This folder contains the materials and exercises for the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting course.
- [javascript-projects](./javascript-projects/): This folder contains the JavaScript projects required to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.
